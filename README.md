# Backend-System-and-Rest-API-Service-using-NestJS-Framework-Typescript-Node-and-Express
TypeScript doesn’t seem to have a good reputation amongst backend developers. Probably because it’s mostly known to be a set of declaration files to add some typing to JavaScript. Yet, a lot of logic that would require dozens of lines of Java code can be handled using just a few lines of TypeScript.

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like Express (the default) and optionally can be configured to use Fastify as well!

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.
